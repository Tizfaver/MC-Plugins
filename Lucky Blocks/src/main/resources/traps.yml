#Config file where you can choose which trap to enable, and which to disable.
#Here you will also able to set custom commands that will be executed (from the player or the console).
#In every trap/effect you will have to set a number, that will be the probability to spawn/do the trap or effect. Set to 0 to disable the trap/effect.
#Remember, these are only my traps, that I made, but if you want, you can add more traps, with the custom command, but you probably will need to create a custom Plugin for this.
